# Go Geocode.xyz Client

This is a simple client for the Geocode.xyz API. This is in the very, very early testing stages, so should not be used by anyone. We welcome contributors, but we strongly recommend you reach out first to ensure that your work and efforts will be in-line with our design, scope, and goals.

_THE API CAN, AND WILL, CHANGE!_ Do not use until this message is removed. This is in a prototyping stage and may never be completed.
